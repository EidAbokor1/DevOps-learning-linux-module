# Level 0 > 1

**Goal:**  
The password for the next level is stored in a file called `readme` located in the home directory.

---

### What I Did:

- Once logged in, I ran `pwd` to confirm I was in the home directory.  
- I used `ls` to list the contents of the directory and found a file named `readme`.  
- I then used the `cat` command to read the file and retrieve the password:

```bash
cat readme
```
**Password Found:**  
`ZjLjTmM6FvvyRnrb2rfNWOZOTa6ip5If`
