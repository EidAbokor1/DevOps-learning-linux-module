# DevOps Learning - Linux Module

This repository contains my practical exercises, notes, and challenge solutions from the Linux module in the CoderCo DevOps course.

## What I learned

- Navigating and managing the Linux file system  
- Understanding file permissions and ownership  
- User and group management basics  
- Process management and monitoring  
- Networking essentials and SSH usage  
- Environment variables and shell basics  
- Hands-on security and command-line challenges with OverTheWire Bandit (Levels 1 to 20)

## OverTheWire Bandit Journey (Levels 1 to 20)

I completed the first 20 levels of the Bandit wargame, which provided practical experience in:

- Command-line navigation and file operations  
- Text processing using tools like `grep`, `sort`, `uniq`, and `diff`  
- Handling various file formats, encodings, and compressions (base64, ROT13, hex, gzip, bzip2, tar)  
- Working with file permissions and ownership to find restricted files  
- Establishing and managing network connections with `nc` (netcat) and `openssl` for SSL/TLS  
- Using SSH with private keys and non-interactive commands to bypass login restrictions  
- Identifying and utilizing setuid binaries for privilege escalation  
- Combining all these skills to solve progressively complex challenges

This journey has greatly improved my Linux command-line proficiency and prepared me for more advanced DevOps and security tasks.
